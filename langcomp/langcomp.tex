HIGHLIGHTS
\begin{itemize}
\item SCOPE
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In this chapter, we discuss language concepts for data locality, their delivery in general-purpose languages, domain-specific languages and active libraries, and the compiler technology to support them.
  \item We explore the proposition that management of locality in parallel programming is a \emph{language} problem.
  \item Language-based solutions may come in the form of new, general-purpose parallel programming languages.  As well as supporting intuitive syntax, doing so creates the scope for ambitious compilation techniques, sophisticated use of type systems, and compile-time checking of important program properties.  
  \item Language concepts for locality can also be delivered within existing languages, supported in libraries, through metaprogramming in C++, and in ``active libraries" with library-specific analysis and optimizations.
  \item Locality is about data, and locality abstractions refer to abstract data types.  Multidimensional arrays are a crucial starting point.  Many more complex domains can be characterized by the abstract, distributed data structure on which parallel computation occurs.  Domain-specific tools are often focussed on particular data structures - graphs, meshes, octtrees, structured adaptive-mesh multigrids etc.  While Chapter~\ref{ch:datastructures} tackles particular data stuctures, in this chapter we look at how to build tools to support programmers who build such abstractions.
  \end{itemize}

\item KEY POINTS
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We need to distinguish between different levels of abstraction, and automation - we need solutions for explicit programmer control over locality and data movement, and we need tools to support composition of parallel components in a way that allows locality and communication to be handled automatically.
  \item We need locality and communication to be robustly evident in the source code, so that programmers have a clear model of execution costs that can be supported by profiling tools.
  \item Language-concepts can support programmers in thinking cleanly about locality (such as distinguishing between local-view and global-view).
  \item Expression of locality needs to be portable across machines.
  \end{itemize}

\item TERMINOLOGY (define each of these up front)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Active library:} a library which comes with a mechanism for delivering library-specific optimizations~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/math-NA-9810022}.  Active library technologies differ in how this is achieved - examples include template metaprogramming in C++, Lightweight Modular Staging in Scala~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/RompfO12}, source-to-source transformation (for example using tools like ROSE~\cite{DBLP:conf/lcpc/YiQ04}), and run-time code generation, driven either by delayed evaluation of library calls~\cite{DBLP:journals/scp/RussellMKB11}, or explicit run-time construction of problem representations or data flow graphs.
  \item \emph{Embedded domain-specific language:} a technique for delivering a language-based solution within a host, general-purpose language~\cite{Hudak96buildingdomain-specific}.  Active libraries often achieve this to some extent, commonly by overloading to capture expression structure.  Truly syntactic embedding is also possible with more ambitious tool support~\cite{Erdweg:2011:SLS:2076021.2048099}.
  \item \emph{Directive-based language extensions:}

  \end{itemize}

\item EXAMPLES OF KEY WORK IN THE AREA
  \begin{itemize}
  \item HPF (and Brad’s blog) - vagueness - robust, well-defined, well-understand abstractions 
  \item UPC (need to have clear ambitions/capability beyond the low-hanging fruit)
  \item Research vehicles can be narrow but a basis for a standard has to have potential for beyond
  \item Titanium, Global arrays
  \end{itemize}

\item AGREEMENTS
  \begin{itemize}
  \item PRINCIPLES
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Avoid losing information through premature ``lowering" of the program representation.
     \item Isolate cross-cutting locality concerns.  Locality --- data layout and distribution --- is fundamentally more difficult than parallelization because it affects all the code that touches the data.   
  \end{itemize}
  \item SOLUTIONS
     \begin{itemize}
     \item There is a lot of consensus around multidimensional data/partitioning/slicing, and how to iterate over them (generators, iterators) - parameterisation of layouts.
     \item There is potential to expose polyhedral concepts to the programmer/IR, and to pass them down to the backend (eg Chapel’s domains, mappings)
     \item The back-end model for the target for code generation and implementation of models/compilers is “missing” - for portable implementation, for interoperability
    \item While we can do a lot with libraries and template metaprogramming, there is a compelling case for a language-based approach
     \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\item  DISAGREEMENTS
  \begin{itemize}
   \item No consensus on the requirements on intermediate representations and runtime systems
   \item Do what I say vs do what I mean [[PK: I thnk this is \emph{agreement} on the need for "multiresolution" solutions, see earlier]]
   \item Compositional metadata vs explicit dependence/synchronisation/movement (Brad has words)

%%%% NOTES FROM THE SCRIBES

%Anshu:
%
%Q. Why a language rather than library, and paths to make it easier 
%to make your language/library adopted
%
%- They are not mutually exclusive, despite long odds we need to keep striving
%   for languages. 
%- Practical reason - syntax matters, things like inferred type and optimization 
%   opportunities better expressed
%- The biggest challenge is getting adopted
%- Academic languages have more challenge to adoption 
%- Template meta programming covers a good percetage of what a language provides
%- The two DSLs based on Python etc they are libraries developed at first by
%    the domain people 
%- Strategically led by applications, essential to maintain the engagement.
%- In order to engage with users - one has to compete with 
%   everything else available
%- Common backend -- target backend c compiler and then provide
%   an appropriate design, take it down to more explicit form 
%- Source to source translator is preferable also for greater portability
%
%- Adoption problem - there is a real hunger for a new language so no excuse for
%   not developing one
%- CUDA- adoption - more than a million downloads, even with small changes
%    timing is important, the real complaint is it only runs on nvidia 
%- Complete rewrite is a red-herring
%
%- The whole tool chain is important,  and interoperability is the key 
%
%Q. What is missing from a common backend 
%
%- targetting C- as a good portable assemble language 
%- 1D array limitation, there is a movement for 
%    support of multi-dimension arrays in C++
%- parallelization/vectorization information
%- lack of any locality information C or C++ how to address it
%- locality is useful even for exploiting memory hierarchy
%- C++ standards committee- all volunteer -- you join ISO pay the fee
%   and then you join the committee and then you attend a few meeting
%   to earn the voting rights
%
%- Locality info is not just hierarchy or also adjacency (helpful for stencils)
%- polyhedral - could be the intermediate information - but the info
%- from the source is lost. How to get this information from the source
%
%- synergy between iteration spaces and domains in chapel, could that
%   be exploited ?
%- X10 is doing polyhedral optimizations, XL compilers are also using it
%   if there is a possibility of closer cooperation
%
%- Polyhedral - parameterization of linearization, the problems that 
%   are coming out are really really hard. You need an affine, most
%   machines cannot be modeled, so then you need hacks. It is
%  a nice mathematical model but not the panacea. 
%- Limitations - Associavity 
%
%- discussion goes back to imperative Vs declarative 
%   with polyhedral model - extracting the representation 
%   from the source code, or you can write into a DSL and emit
%  the source. Once you have lifted away from having to extract
%  the model why constrain ?
%
%- This is because the community knows how to solve the convex
%   optimization problems but not much as. 
%- The other side is correctness, the limiting factor. 
%
%- Calculus of problem transformation, separate from the actual
%  optimization. Which transformation to apply to what optimization
%  not too many are optimizations are applied all at once.
%- Restrictions imposed by the 
%  polyhedral model, interesting cases is when the subscript case
%  is indirection - is the meta-data becomes bigger than the data
%  so it has to done at runtime
%
%- Automatic compiler techniques - have them for years auto-parallelization
%   we gave up on it, so are we going back to it.
%
%- Data locality -- instead of expressing where the data is, but express
%   implicitly the relation and hierarchy, sufficiently broad possibilities
%   so that it can support a range of back-ends. 
%- In stencil explicitly specify the shape of the stencil, sometimes 
%   you can generate automatic parallelization
%- Right container libraries or constructs will be helpful
%
%- Robustness--if you are counting on the compiler to do auto-parallelization
% for you it needs to be robust. 
%- Data movement implied by the parallelism,
%  what the data access footprint of the loop is. If you break that, the compiler
%  should be able to tell you. Column major Vs row major, if there is a transpose
%  the profiler should point out. Anamoly detection.
%- Expressing locality should be portable, pushing that from applications space
%   to the runtime space. May be unrealistic to push it to the compiler space.
%- Whether all the things should be visible in the syntax of the data structure
%  nice for analysis, the flip side is lack of portability. Ability to reason about
%  the locality in semantic ways is more important, ability to put in assertions
%   and then tools. 
%- Locality and profiler -- how much can a compiler do
%
%- whether your code expresses its belief about its performance characteristics
%- semantic information conveyed to the system could be statically
%   analyzed, the compiler may make the decision to utilize it.
%- The ability to express in a language may be exploited first at the runtime,
%   rather than the compiler.
%- Compositionality - communication and the locality depends on the context.

%
%Language and Compiler Support for Data Locality 
%
%Why a language rather than a library?
%Brad: fully adapted, pursing lanauge. Keep trieving a lanaugeg because 
%in the long term people want lanauge, syntax matters a lot 
%hard to do in a library, optimization opportunies for compiler 
%
%Amir: Titanium, no one used it. Things are different when vendor supports. 
%Users think that the language 
%Language provides many opportunies 
%Embedded DSL and metaprogramming is a good alternative. 
%We can get most of the lanauge provides. 
%
%Paul: both his DSL are libraries. not language 
%strategically he has to engage with app ppl. It is important to work the app ppl. 
%I am agnostic about how it is deliver to you(compiler). How you get it 
%it is not important. Delay execution
%
%Armind: barrier to adopting a new language is hard 
%syntax extensions are possible 
%
%Cj: go after users? if you want to be portable
%John: if you don't have a common back 
%
%Amir: src-to-src translators address that
%
%Naoya: compiler doesn't mean all the way from high to asembly 
%but to some intermediate form 
%final output is left to the vendor compiler 
%
%Brad: there is a true hunger in users. Users do not have a choice 
%because it is hard because it is no user group, we shouldn't develop a new langa
%that's wrong , that's a dissoppioiting excuse.
%
%Peter: about CUDA, we have 1M downloads. Few syntactic changes, and people 
%are complaining. wondering about timing 
%
%Brad: why java and python are new language and they got adopted. 
%great interoperability 
%
%Didem: complaint about CUDA is not the extension but optimizations 
%because it requires a lot of rewrite of the code 
%
%Carter: entire tool chain change required for CUDA
%
%Anshu: interoperatability is important for a new language because 
%you have to rewrite entire your code 
%
%Brad: he agress interoperatbility. 
%
%John: DSL and lang targetting LLVM  
%is the question what is missing in common backend to inhibits your locality optimizations?
%what is missing in LLVM? or IR?
%
%Brad: targetting C, it is portable assembly 
%multidimensional arrays are missing. C++ next standard is targetting multidim 
%arrays, that will be great. 
%
%Amir: targetting C and C++, lack of any locality information are missing 
%C++11 has some model for parallelism. 
%
%Didem: How to influence C++ committee to address HPC needs?
%
%Carter: join ISO first. pay C++17 ISO join fee
%certain number of meetings to earn voting 
%
%....
%
%...
%
%Armid: annotation and better langauge can provide more info to polyhedral
%LLVM is too low level close to assembly with type info 
%
%...
%
%Kathy: IBM is now working with polyhedral and it is actually XL compiler 
%
%John: algebraic model, data model theory?
%
%Torsten: only applicable to DSL, to fine domain. 
%parameterized integer programming is not pragtical.
%it not a panacea
%
%Thomas: users need something different than imperative langauge 
%python 
%pollyhedral models fall back into 
%
%Torsten: you can extract the poly representation from the source, that source can be 
%anything. convex optimizations, affine functions are easier to solve in the compiler. 
%So it is good that ployhedral constrains your source 
%
%Armind: preserve the correctness of the program, that's the limiting factor 
%the user shouldn't see what's going on 
%
%Padua: optimization process is different that poly 
%
%Armind: objective function 
%we apply opitmizations in order, first parallelization, then locality and then tiling etc. 
%
%...
%
%Paul: people are talking about restrictions of ploy. that's actually great 
%indirection is interesting, metadata that charactizing the iteration space 
%that has to be done in runtime 
%
%
%John: How do we make the data locality and data movement in a program robustly evident in the code?
%what additional information do you need from programmer (model)?
%We gave up on auto parallelization and auto data locality.
%
%Peter: explicitly declared the proximity of the data in Pylaxn
%
%Naoya: in a stencil case, explicitly define stencil shape. COmpiler can generate optimized code.
%even for distributed memory. 
%
%Armind: right data structure 
%
%Paul: 
%1) robustness: in a good day, it gives good performance but always but you need robustness. 
%When the user breaks he knows. 
%
%2) Data movement: how data is distributed
%data access footprint 
%sometimes you need to even declare it 
%
%3) loop 1 and loop 2 : between the two, all to all broadcast. 
%suddenly, it
%profiler should tell you about this bottleneck
%
%Amir: data locality in a portable manner 
%Peter had the right idea. push it from the application to runtime. 
%Pushing to the compiler is too hard. Runtime can do better job. 
%
%Brad: Making the movement explicit 
%it doesn't need to be syntactically 
%all the communication is exploict in the langauge. 
%It had a drawback. because it is portable
%Syntaxtically in Chapel we avoided that. 
%Semantically expressing data locatity is the way to go not syntaxtically 
%
%Padua: how much can compiler do? 
%it is temporaily in the language until the compiler 
%
%Paul: performance properties of your code. If I break your assumptions, 
%I want to 
%compiler fails without an explanation. 
%
%Satoshi: semantic info can convey should be something should 
%be dynamic, hand to the runtime. Some of them can be statically analzyed in the compiler. 
%
%JOhn: HPF had the mistake that putting everything to the compiler. 
%
%Paul: composition: locality depends on the context

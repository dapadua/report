Summary of feedbacks on other chapters

From Romain:
    - Langcomp
        - Management of locality in parallel programming is indeed a language
        problem but not only.
        - Explicit programmer control over locality: they mention a bit later
        that the expression of locality needs to be portable across
        machines so this should stand out here too; I think it is important
        to state that locality control is not about stating that a particular
        task is mapped to a given core etc. (no machine portability).
        - Strongly agree on the part about avoiding the loss of
        information through premature lowering
    - Datastructures
        - Memory spaces: I would also explicitly call out scratchpads
        in the taxonomy. Also, "one or more levels of cache" => "zero
        or more levels of cache" (even today's GPUs for example
        directly access some memory without going through cache I
        think).
        - Locality: the definition only covers spatial locality and it
        also seems to restrict itself to distance between data
        elements and not data and core. The definition of distance is
        also probably not just a space-based thing.
        - Execution policy: not sure I understand the definition. Work
        is mapped onto data-collections? Shouldn't work be mapped to
        computation resources (cores) and data collections mapped to
        memory spaces.
        - For the model to assess data-locality: is this model fully
        exposed to the application user? It seems like the model
        described is low-level enough ("computational elements",
        "memory structures") that it is more for the expert or runtime
        mapping.
    - Systemscale
        - over-decomposition model: I think I understand what is meant
        here but a clear explanation might be nice because I don't
        know if everyone agrees on the level of "over" in
        "over-decomposition".
    - Apps
        - Definition of a "data-model" is missingbut it is used
        frequently in the text.
        - What would need to be in the "stable paradigm to program to"
